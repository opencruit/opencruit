If you have an entrepreneurial spirit and are passionate about delivering great customer experiences, we invite you to join our growing team.</p><p>To maintain our position as a leading digital platform for selling used equipment, we are looking for an <b>Account Manager</b> to join our team in <b>the UK</b>.</p><p>In this role you are always on the move. Traveling your working area and working from your (home)office, you build relationships with (new) customers as the preferred partner when- and wherever they want to sell used equipment. You will be responsible for the <b>South West &amp; South East part</b> of the UK. You sell our listing service (formally known as Mascus) which gives your client the opportunity to be fully in control of the sales process.</p><p>Your activities are close to those of your colleagues of our Marketplace-E team. The main difference: you are bringing a solution to your client which has the highest investment to pay-out ratio. Your business moves fast and so do you. Your main goal is to generate a continuous flow of new equipment listings. Making outbound calls through-out the day in high volumes is how you make sure the sales process never stops.

You know that high input plus discipline equals a constant and high pay-out. Nevertheless, our business requires more than closing a single deal. Strong relationship building skills are essential in this role. It would be great if you had a connection to heavy machinery as this makes it easier to understand your client\u2019s business, but it is not a requirement. You do have:</p><ul><li>At least 4 years of experience in account management or inside sales</li><li>Professional level English</li><li>Experience leveraging CRM-tools</li></ul><h3>What We Offer</h3><p>When you join <a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/ritchie-bros\">Ritchie Bros.</a> we want you to be on board for a long time. From the start we\u2019ll give you an indefinite employment agreement and plenty of professional and career development opportunities combined with fair pay. Across Europe we have 45 colleagues in our Mascus team. Once an independent company, our Mascus team still has an above average feeling of teamwork and comradery. The team has an average length of employment of almost 6 years even though we have had a lot of new joiners. If you love working in a diverse sales team, this is where you need to be!</p><h3>Who are we?</h3><p><a href=\"https://himalayas.app/companies/ritchie-bros\">Ritchie Bros.</a> is a global asset management and disposition company.
